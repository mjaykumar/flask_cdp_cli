Push an Existing Project to GitHub:

Step 1: Create a Repo in Github: for ex flask_cdp_cli.git. You can choose to either initialize a README or not. It doesn't really matter because we're just going to override everything in this remote repository anyways.

Step 2 : - Initialize Git in the project folder

git init
git add -A
git commit -m 'Added my project'
git remote add origin git@github.com:scotch-io/my-new-project.git  ( using ssh methodology )
git remote add origin https://github.com/mjaykumar/flask_cdp_cli.git  ( using https , will ask uid and pwd )
git remote -v
git push origin master
git pull origin master
